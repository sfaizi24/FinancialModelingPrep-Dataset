You run it in the order Ticker Symbols -> Statements -> Prices

Step2 Phase 1 was purely a solution for me because I already had a ton of data locally from previous failed attempts. For you you can just let it fail at that step and Step 2 Phase 2 will just call the API for it all.

I had to do weird stuff in Getting Price Data to get duckdb to be okay with my ipywidgets installation, ask chatgpt for help there

My beautiful wife pointed out to me that Michaels (traded under MIK) is not featured in my dataset, even though it was publicly traded until being acquired by PE in 2021. I have 0 idea why it doesn't show up in the de-listed symbols endpoint, even though it does have price data on the chart endpoints. It looks like an error on FMPs part, and I have not checked to see if other de-listed companies are suffering from this as well.
